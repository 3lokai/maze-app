## 🎯 Educational Philosophy

**Why Desktop Only?**

This game is intentionally designed as a desktop-only experience to:

- **Promote Focused Learning**: Larger screens provide better visibility and reduce distractions
- **Build Programming Skills**: Desktop interfaces are better suited for learning programming concepts
- **Encourage Family Time**: Designed for shared learning experiences on family computers
- **Reduce Screen Addiction**: Encourages kids to use computers for educational purposes rather than mobile devices

## 🚀 Features

- **Multi-Player Programming Challenges**: 2-4 players can compete and collaborate
- **Visual Programming Interface**: Drag-and-drop command building
- **Multiple Maze Themes**: Castle, Forest, Mountain, City, and Garden layouts
- **Educational Focus**: Teaches programming logic, problem-solving, and spatial reasoning
- **Accessibility Features**: High contrast mode, reduced motion support, keyboard navigation

## 🖥️ System Requirements

- **Desktop or Laptop Computer** (Windows, macOS, or Linux)
- **Modern Web Browser** (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- **Minimum Screen Size**: 768px width (tablet or larger)
