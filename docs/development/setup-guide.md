# ðŸš€ Setup Guide for v1+ Development

## Quick Start

Since you've already added CodeRabbit to your GitHub account, here's how to get started with the new Git workflow:

### 1. **Verify CodeRabbit Integration**

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Check that CodeRabbit appears in the "Apps" section
3. Ensure it has access to your repository

### 2. **Set Up Branch Protection (Recommended)**

1. Go to your repository â†’ Settings â†’ Branches
2. Add rule for `develop` branch:
   - âœ… Require a pull request before merging
   - âœ… Require status checks to pass before merging
   - âœ… Require branches to be up to date before merging
   - âœ… Include administrators

### 3. **Test the Workflow**

```bash
# Create a test feature branch
git checkout -b test/workflow-setup

# Make a small change
echo "# Test workflow" >> README.md

# Commit and push
git add README.md
git commit -m "test: verify workflow setup"
git push origin test/workflow-setup

# Create a test PR
gh pr create --title "test: verify workflow setup" --body "Testing the new workflow" --base develop
```

### 4. **Start Your First Epic**

```bash
# Create feature branch for Epic 1
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b feature/epic-1-flexible-players

# Start development following the workflow in docs/development/git-workflow.md
```
