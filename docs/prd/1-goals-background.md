# 1. Goals & Background

The **Coding Maze** app introduces children (ages 4–6) to computational thinking through **touch-based command building**. Kids tap arrows (U, D, L, R) and numbers (1–10) to assemble sequences like `U×5, R×3`. Pressing **Run** animates their piece step-by-step through a fixed 10×10 maze.

This mechanic blends **visual play with symbolic syntax**, reinforcing sequencing, batching, and **deferred execution** ("write first, then run"). Immediate feedback ensures engagement: illegal moves shake + toast; reaching the goal triggers confetti.

v0 is designed for **two players taking alternate turns** — each child builds and runs their own sequence, then play passes automatically to the other. This setup encourages turn-taking, cooperative play, and sibling/parent co-play without requiring accounts or complex setup. The app remains **safe, ad-free, and purpose-built for short learning sessions**.
