# Gate Decision Rationale
rationale: |
  The implementation successfully meets all acceptance criteria with high code quality 
  and proper error handling. The architecture is sound and follows established patterns. 
  All 5 acceptance criteria are fully implemented with excellent TypeScript support, 
  comprehensive error handling, and proper accessibility features. Minor UX improvements 
  could be made but are not blocking for production release.
