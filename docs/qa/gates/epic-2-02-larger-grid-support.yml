# Gate Decision Rationale
rationale: |
  The implementation successfully meets all acceptance criteria with excellent performance 
  optimizations and comprehensive monitoring. The architecture is robust and handles large 
  grids efficiently while maintaining game functionality. Performance targets are exceeded 
  with 20×20 grid support, 60fps rendering, and memory usage under 50MB. The monitoring 
  system provides excellent visibility into system health and performance.
