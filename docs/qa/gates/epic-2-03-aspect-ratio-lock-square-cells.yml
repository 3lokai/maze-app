# Gate Decision Rationale
rationale: |
  The implementation successfully meets all acceptance criteria with excellent responsive 
  design and proper aspect ratio maintenance. The CSS architecture is well-structured and 
  provides consistent behavior across all device sizes. All 5 acceptance criteria are fully 
  implemented with proper CSS custom properties, comprehensive responsive breakpoints, and 
  hardware acceleration for smooth performance. Browser compatibility considerations are 
  noted but not blocking for production release.
