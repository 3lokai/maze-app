## 🎯 Organization Pattern

Following the established pattern from v0-completed:
- **Completed work**: Stories in `stories/` folder with completion status in `index.md`
- **Active work**: Stories in `stories/` folder with implementation status
- **Consistent structure**: Each epic/sprint has its own `index.md` and `stories/` folder
