## 🎯 Benefits of New Organization

### 1. **Clear Hierarchy**
- **Epics**: High-level business goals with multiple related stories
- **Sprints**: Time-boxed development cycles with focused stories
- **Backlog**: Completed work organized by implementation order
- **Shared**: Common resources and cross-references

### 2. **Consistent Naming**
- All story files use numbered prefixes (01-, 02-, etc.)
- Descriptive names without size/priority suffixes
- Clear separation between different story types

### 3. **Easy Navigation**
- Each epic/sprint has its own index file
- Main index in shared directory provides overview
- Clear dependency mapping and implementation order

### 4. **Scalable Structure**
- Easy to add new epics or sprints
- Stories can be moved between categories as needed
- Shared resources prevent duplication
