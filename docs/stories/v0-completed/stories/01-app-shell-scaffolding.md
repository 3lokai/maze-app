Story 1: App Shell Scaffolding (XS)

**As a** developer  
**I want** a clean Next.js 15 app shell with Tailwind v4 and shadcn/ui components  
**So that** the foundation is ready for maze game development

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Replace default Next.js page with minimal maze app shell
- [x] Configure Tailwind v4 with proper theme setup in `globals.css`
- [x] Install and configure shadcn/ui components (button, card, badge, select, toggle, tooltip, separator, sonner)
- [x] Create responsive layout container (â‰¥768px breakpoint)
- [x] Ensure no console errors on app boot
- [x] Add proper TypeScript strict mode configuration

**Technical Notes:**
- Use `components.json` for shadcn configuration
- Follow existing `tsconfig.json` strict settings
- Layout should be ready for maze grid, HUD, and controls

**Files to Create/Modify:**
- `src/app/page.tsx` - Main app shell
- `src/app/globals.css` - Tailwind configuration
- `components.json` - shadcn setup
- `src/components/ui/` - shadcn components
