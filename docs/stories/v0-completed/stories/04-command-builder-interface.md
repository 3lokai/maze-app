Story 4: Command Builder Interface (M)

**As a** player  
**I want** to build movement commands by tapping direction + number  
**So that** I can create complex movement sequences

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Create direction buttons (U/D/L/R) with visual feedback
- [x] Create number buttons (1-10) for movement distance
- [x] Display command queue showing built tokens (e.g., "UÃ—5, RÃ—3")
- [x] Implement Undo button to remove last command
- [x] Implement Reset button to clear entire queue
- [x] Queue updates in real-time as commands are added

**Technical Notes:**
- Command format: `{ direction: 'U'|'D'|'L'|'R', steps: number }`
- Queue display: "UÃ—5, RÃ—3, DÃ—2" format
- Use shadcn Button components with proper sizing

**Files to Create/Modify:**
- `src/components/CommandBuilder.tsx` - Main command interface
- `src/components/DirectionButtons.tsx` - Direction controls
- `src/components/NumberPad.tsx` - Number input buttons
- `src/components/CommandQueue.tsx` - Queue display
- `src/types/commands.ts` - Command-related types
