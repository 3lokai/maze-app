# 🎭 Sprint 2 Epic — Coding Maze

## 📋 Sprint 2 Backlog — Coding Maze

### **Story 1 — Maze Layout Loader (S)**

**As a** player  
**I want** the app to load a pre-baked maze layout from JSON  
**So that** I see paths, start, and goal clearly marked.

* **INVEST:** Independent (just reads JSON), valuable (maze appears), estimable (S), small, testable.
* **AC:**
  * Loads `MazeLayout` JSON with `width`, `height`, `start`, `goal`, `path[]`.
  * Start badge renders ("Home"), goal badge renders ("Forest").
  * Non-path cells visible but not playable.
* **Demo =** Launch app → see maze grid with path and labels.

---

### **Story 2 — Constrained Movement (M)**

**As a** player  
**I want** my moves blocked if I try to step outside the path  
**So that** I must follow the maze.

* **INVEST:** Independent (executor check), valuable, estimable (M), small, testable.
* **AC:**
  * Executor checks if next cell ∈ `path[]`.
  * Illegal move = shake + toast ("Bumped wall at step N"); position unchanged.
  * Trail only marks path cells.
* **Demo =** Queue moves into wall → shake, toast; queue valid path → token follows trail.

---

### **Story 3 — Theme Labels (XS)**

**As a** child  
**I want** start/goal to have fun names or icons  
**So that** it feels like a mini-story.

* **AC:** Configurable `labels.start`, `labels.goal` render under badges.
* **Demo =** Maze loads with "Home" → "Forest" visible.

---

### **Story 4 — Header Controls Refactor (S)**

**As a** parent  
**I want** Play Again, Settings, and Stats in the header  
**So that** the play area is uncluttered for kids.

* **AC:**
  * Header right side hosts: Play Again (green), ⚙️ Settings dropdown (HC/Soft/Reduced Motion/Large Text), 📊 Stats button.
  * Removed from right rail.
* **Demo =** Load app → controls visible in header only.

---

### **Story 5 — Right Rail Simplify (S)**

**As a** player  
**I want** the right rail to show only gameplay controls  
**So that** I focus on commands and turns.

* **AC:** Right rail shows: Turn indicator, Command Builder, Queue Rail, Run/Step/Speed.
* **Demo =** No Play Again/Settings/Stats clutter in the rail.

---

### **Story 6 — Stats Drawer (S)**

**As a** parent  
**I want** an easy way to see wins and crashes totals  
**So that** I can track progress without cluttering gameplay.

* **AC:**
  * Stats button in header opens drawer/panel.
  * Shows per-player wins/crashes + totals.
  * Accessible (ESC closes, focus trap, screenreader labels).
* **Demo =** Click stats → drawer slides in → shows correct counts.

---

### **Story 7 — UI Polish (M)**

**As a** child  
**I want** bigger, clearer buttons and visual feedback  
**So that** I can tap confidently and enjoy the game.

* **AC:**
  * Direction/number buttons ≥44–56px, show arrow + label text.
  * Queue tokens: arrow + number (⬆×3 pill), color-coded per player.
  * Executor progress shows progress bar per player.
  * Tap feedback = bounce animation.
  * Active player HUD glows.
* **Demo =** Tapping buttons feels responsive, queue tokens playful, progress bar fills.
