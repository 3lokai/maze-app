# Story Sprint 2-5: Right Rail Simplify (S)

**As a** player  
**I want** the right rail to show only gameplay controls  
**So that** I focus on commands and turns.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Right rail shows: Turn indicator, Command Builder, Queue Rail, Run/Step/Speed
- [x] No Play Again/Settings/Stats clutter in the rail
- [x] Layout is clean and focused on gameplay
- [x] All gameplay controls remain easily accessible
- [x] Responsive design maintained
- [x] Visual hierarchy emphasizes gameplay elements

**Technical Notes:**
- Refactor right rail layout to focus on gameplay
- Ensure TurnCard, CommandBuilder, and Executor remain prominent
- Remove non-gameplay controls from rail
- Maintain proper spacing and visual balance
- Integrate with header controls refactor

**Files to Create/Modify:**
- `src/app/page.tsx` - Refactor right rail layout
- `src/components/GameRail.tsx` - New focused gameplay rail component
- `src/components/TurnCard.tsx` - Ensure proper integration
- `src/components/CommandBuilder.tsx` - Ensure proper integration
- `src/components/Executor.tsx` - Ensure proper integration

**Story Dependencies:**
- Depends on Story Sprint 2-4 (Header Controls Refactor) for control relocation
- Depends on Story 3 (Two Players & Visual Tokens) for TurnCard
- Depends on Story 4 (Command Builder Interface) for CommandBuilder
- Depends on Story 5 (Movement Executor Engine) for Executor

**Demo Criteria:**
No Play Again/Settings/Stats clutter in the rail.

**Story Size:** Small (S)

**Priority:** Medium - UI organization
