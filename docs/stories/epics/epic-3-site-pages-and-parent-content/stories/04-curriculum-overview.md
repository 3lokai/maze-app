# Story 4 â€” Curriculum Overview Page (M)

**As a** parent  
**I want** to see the roadmap of coding concepts  
**So that** I know what my child will learn next.

## Acceptance Criteria

* `/curriculum` route with chapter cards timeline
* 4-5 chapter cards: Sequencing â†’ Multipliers â†’ Checks â†’ Hazards â†’ Advanced
* Each card shows: concept icon, skills learned, difficulty level
* "Coming Soon" badges for unimplemented chapters

## Demo

Open `/curriculum` â†’ cards show learning progression with status.

## Implementation Notes

- Medium complexity story
- Part of the second implementation phase
- Requires Story 5 (Curriculum JSON Stub) to be completed first
- Uses JSON-driven data for flexibility
- Prepare for Story 6 (Parent Dashboard Hook) integration
