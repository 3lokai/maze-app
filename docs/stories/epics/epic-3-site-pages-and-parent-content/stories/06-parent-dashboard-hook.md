# Story 6 â€” Parent Dashboard Hook (S)

**As a** parent  
**I want** connection between Curriculum and Parent Dashboard  
**So that** I see child progress against chapters.

## Acceptance Criteria

* Curriculum cards show progress badges: Not Started/In Progress/Completed
* Parent Dashboard shows curriculum progress section
* Uses placeholder progress data (Epic 4 will add real tracking)
* Export includes curriculum progress

## Demo

Dashboard shows "Chapter 1: Completed", curriculum cards reflect status.

## Implementation Notes

- Small complexity story
- Part of the third implementation phase
- Requires Stories 4 and 5 to be completed first
- Uses placeholder data for Epic 4 preparation
- Focus on UI integration and data flow
