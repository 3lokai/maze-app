# Story 7 â€” Storage Abstraction (M)

**As a** developer  
**I want** storage abstraction for future cloud sync  
**So that** Epic 4 can add authentication without rework.

## Acceptance Criteria

* `StorageProvider` interface with `get/set/remove/clear` methods
* `LocalStorageProvider` implements interface with namespace `coding-maze/v1`
* Migration-safe keys: `players`, `settings`, `stats`, `progress`
* Game components use abstraction, not direct localStorage

## Demo

Settings persist, game works same, ready for cloud provider swap.

## Implementation Notes

- Medium complexity story
- First story in implementation order (foundation)
- Critical for Epic 4 preparation
- Focus on interface design and migration safety
- Requires careful testing to ensure no data loss
