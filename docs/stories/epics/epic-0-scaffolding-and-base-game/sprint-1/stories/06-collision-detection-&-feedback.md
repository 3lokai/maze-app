Story 6: Collision Detection & Feedback (M)

**As a** player  
**I want** clear feedback when I hit walls or make illegal moves  
**So that** I understand why my movement failed

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Detect wall collisions during movement execution
- [x] Stop execution immediately on collision
- [x] Shake animation on target cell when collision occurs
- [x] Display toast notification: "Bumped wall at step N"
- [x] Increment crash counter for active player
- [x] Visual feedback on collision (red flash, shake)

**Technical Notes:**
- Use shadcn Sonner for toast notifications
- CSS keyframes for shake animation
- Collision detection in `/lib/executor.ts`

**Files to Create/Modify:**
- `src/components/CollisionFeedback.tsx` - Visual feedback component
- `src/lib/executor.ts` - Add collision detection logic
- `src/styles/animations.css` - Shake and flash animations
- `src/hooks/useCollision.ts` - Collision detection hook

## QA Results

**QA Agent:** Quinn (Test Architect)

**Review Date:** 2024-12-19

**QA Gate Decision:** âœ… **PASS**

**Requirements Traceability:**
- âœ… Detect wall collisions during movement execution
- âœ… Stop execution immediately on collision
- âœ… Shake animation on target cell when collision occurs
- âœ… Display toast notification: "Bumped wall at step N"
- âœ… Increment crash counter for active player
- âœ… Visual feedback on collision (red flash, shake)

**Technical Assessment:**
- **Architecture**: Excellent collision detection system with `useCollision` hook and `CollisionFeedback` component
- **Visual Feedback**: Comprehensive animation system with shake, flash, and pulse effects
- **Integration**: Seamless connection between executor and collision detection systems
- **User Experience**: Clear feedback with toast notifications and visual animations
- **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels and haptic feedback support

**Quality Attributes:**
- **Performance**: Efficient collision detection with proper timeout management
- **User Experience**: Multiple feedback mechanisms (visual, haptic, toast) for clear communication
- **Maintainability**: Clean separation between collision detection and visual feedback
- **Reliability**: Robust error handling with proper state cleanup

**Code Quality:**
- **Hook Design**: `useCollision` provides comprehensive collision state management
- **Component Structure**: `CollisionFeedback` component with proper visual effects
- **Animation System**: Well-designed CSS animations with proper timing
- **Integration**: Excellent connection with executor callbacks and game state

**Technical Implementation:**
- **Toast Notifications**: Proper Sonner integration with detailed error messages
- **Animation Timing**: Correct 1-second collision state duration matching animation length
- **State Management**: Clean collision state with proper timeout cleanup
- **Visual Effects**: Multiple animation types (shake, flash, pulse) for comprehensive feedback

**Build Status:** âœ… Successful production build with no critical errors

**Risk Assessment:** Low - All requirements met, excellent collision feedback system
