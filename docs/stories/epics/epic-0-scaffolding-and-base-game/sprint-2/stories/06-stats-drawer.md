# Story Sprint 2-6: Stats Drawer (S)

**As a** parent  
**I want** an easy way to see wins and crashes totals  
**So that** I can track progress without cluttering gameplay.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Stats button in header opens drawer/panel
- [x] Shows per-player wins/crashes + totals with visual icons (🏆💥👣)
- [x] Accessible (ESC closes, focus trap, screenreader labels)
- [x] Drawer slides in from right side
- [x] Stats update in real-time during gameplay
- [x] Clean, organized display of statistics
- [x] Visual hierarchy with icons for kid-friendly reading

**Technical Notes:**
- Use shadcn Sheet component for drawer functionality
- Integrate with existing game state for real-time updates
- Implement proper focus management and keyboard navigation
- Use proper ARIA labels and roles for accessibility
- Statistics should persist across game sessions
- Use visual icons (🏆 for wins, 💥 for crashes, 👣 for steps) for kid-friendly display
- Ensure icons are accessible with proper alt text

**Files to Create/Modify:**
- `src/components/StatsDrawer.tsx` - New stats drawer component
- `src/components/PlayerStats.tsx` - Individual player statistics display with icons
- `src/components/Scoreboard.tsx` - Overall statistics summary with visual icons
- `src/hooks/useStats.ts` - Statistics management hook
- `src/store/gameStore.ts` - Ensure stats are properly tracked
- `src/components/ui/icons.tsx` - Add stat icons (trophy, explosion, footsteps)

**Story Dependencies:**
- Depends on Story Sprint 2-4 (Header Controls Refactor) for stats button
- Depends on Story 3 (Two Players & Visual Tokens) for player data
- Depends on Story 6 (Collision Detection & Feedback) for crash tracking
- Depends on Story 7 (Goal Achievement & Celebration) for win tracking

**Demo Criteria:**
Click stats → drawer slides in → shows correct counts.

**Story Size:** Small (S)

**Priority:** Medium - Parent functionality
