# Story 4 ‚Äî Label & Emoji Overlays

## User Story

**As a** child  
**I want** start/goal labels and emoji sprites inside cells  
**So that** they don't break the grid shape.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Labels/icons rendered as absolute overlays
- [ ] Font-size capped; ‚â§390px shows icons only + legend below board
- [ ] Emojis fixed size, don't resize cell
- [ ] Text remains readable across all cell sizes
- [ ] Overlays don't interfere with game interactions

## Technical Requirements

### Overlay System
- Use absolute positioning for all labels and emojis
- Implement proper z-indexing to ensure visibility
- Scale content based on cell size and viewport
- Maintain touch accessibility for interactive elements

### Responsive Text Handling
- Dynamic font sizing based on cell dimensions
- Fallback to icons-only on small screens (‚â§390px)
- Legend display below board for small screens
- Maintain readability across all device sizes

### Emoji and Icon Management
- Fixed-size emoji sprites that don't affect cell dimensions
- Consistent icon sizing across different cell sizes
- Proper contrast and visibility for all icons
- Accessibility considerations for icon-only displays

## Implementation Tasks

1. **Overlay Positioning System** ‚úÖ
   - [x] Implement absolute positioning for cell content
   - [x] Create overlay container within each cell
   - [x] Set up proper z-index hierarchy
   - [x] Ensure overlays don't block game interactions

2. **Responsive Text Scaling** ‚úÖ
   - [x] Create dynamic font sizing system
   - [x] Implement breakpoints for text/icon switching
   - [x] Add legend component for small screens
   - [x] Test readability across all device sizes

3. **Emoji and Icon Components** ‚úÖ
   - [x] Create reusable emoji/icon components
   - [x] Implement fixed-size sprite system
   - [x] Add proper accessibility attributes
   - [x] Ensure consistent rendering across browsers

4. **Content Management** ‚úÖ
   - [x] Update cell rendering to use overlay system
   - [x] Implement content scaling based on cell size
   - [x] Add proper fallbacks for missing content

5. **Accessibility and UX** ‚úÖ
   - [x] Ensure touch targets remain accessible
   - [x] Add proper ARIA labels for screen readers
   - [x] Test with different accessibility tools
   - [x] Validate color contrast requirements

## Demo Criteria

**Demo:** Start cell shows üè° overlay, goal shows üå≥; grid stays aligned

### Demo Steps
1. Load maze with start and goal cells
2. Verify start cell shows üè° emoji overlay
3. Verify goal cell shows üå≥ emoji overlay
4. Confirm grid alignment remains intact
5. Test on small screen (‚â§390px) - icons only with legend
6. Verify text remains readable on larger screens

## Definition of Done

- [x] All labels and emojis use absolute overlay positioning
- [x] Text scales appropriately for different cell sizes
- [x] Small screens show icons-only with legend
- [x] Grid alignment remains unaffected by overlays
- [x] Touch interactions work properly
- [x] Accessibility requirements met
- [x] Demo criteria met
- [x] Code reviewed and tested

## Dependencies

- Existing maze renderer component
- Cell rendering system
- Responsive design utilities

## Notes

- Focus on maintaining grid integrity while adding visual content
- Consider performance impact of overlay rendering
- Ensure accessibility compliance for all content types
