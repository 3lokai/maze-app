# Story 7 — Renderer Performance Optimization

## User Story

**As a** developer  
**I want** the renderer optimized for large mazes  
**So that** gameplay remains smooth.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] 20×20 map runs step animation at 60fps
- [ ] Memory stable (no leaks across resets)
- [ ] Confetti and trail rendering cost < 10ms per frame
- [ ] Smooth performance across all grid sizes
- [ ] No performance degradation during extended play

## Technical Requirements

### Performance Targets
- Maintain 60fps (16.67ms frame budget) for all animations
- Memory usage < 50MB for largest grids
- Confetti/trail rendering < 10ms per frame
- Smooth step execution regardless of grid size

### Rendering Optimization
- Implement efficient cell rendering with minimal DOM updates
- Use CSS transforms for animations instead of layout changes
- Implement viewport culling for large grids
- Optimize memory usage with object pooling

### Memory Management
- Monitor and prevent memory leaks
- Implement proper cleanup for dynamic content
- Use efficient data structures for large grids
- Profile memory usage during extended play sessions

## Implementation Tasks

1. **Performance Profiling**
   - Set up performance monitoring tools
   - Profile current rendering performance
   - Identify bottlenecks in rendering pipeline
   - Establish baseline metrics for optimization

2. **Rendering Pipeline Optimization**
   - Implement efficient cell rendering system
   - Use CSS transforms for animations
   - Add viewport culling for large grids
   - Optimize DOM updates and reflows

3. **Memory Management**
   - Implement object pooling for dynamic content
   - Add memory leak detection and prevention
   - Optimize data structures for large grids
   - Monitor memory usage during extended play

4. **Animation Optimization**
   - Optimize confetti and trail rendering
   - Implement efficient animation systems
   - Use requestAnimationFrame for smooth animations
   - Minimize layout thrashing during animations

5. **Testing and Validation**
   - Test performance on various devices and grid sizes
   - Monitor memory usage during extended play
   - Validate 60fps performance targets
   - Profile and optimize identified bottlenecks

## Demo Criteria

**Demo:** Profile in dev tools → frame time <16ms during 20×20 run

### Demo Steps
1. Load a 20×20 maze layout
2. Open browser dev tools performance tab
3. Start recording performance
4. Execute a complex path across the entire grid
5. Stop recording and analyze frame times
6. Verify frame times consistently < 16ms
7. Check memory usage remains stable

## Definition of Done

- [ ] 20×20 grids maintain 60fps performance
- [ ] Memory usage remains stable during extended play
- [ ] Confetti/trail rendering < 10ms per frame
- [ ] Performance monitoring implemented
- [ ] Demo criteria met
- [ ] Code reviewed and tested

## Dependencies

- Existing maze renderer system
- Performance monitoring tools
- Browser dev tools for profiling

## Notes

- Focus on maintaining smooth performance over visual complexity
- Profile on actual target devices, not just development machines
- Consider progressive optimization for different performance tiers
