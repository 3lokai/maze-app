# Story 3 â€” Aspect-Ratio Lock & Square Cells

## User Story

**As a** player  
**I want** cells to stay perfect squares  
**So that** the maze doesn't distort on different devices.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Board container uses aspect-ratio `width/height`
- [x] Each cell maintains aspect-ratio 1
- [x] No stretch when labels/emojis present
- [x] Grid remains square across all screen sizes
- [x] Cells scale proportionally with viewport changes

## Technical Requirements

### CSS Implementation
- Use CSS Grid with `aspect-ratio` property
- Implement responsive sizing that maintains square cells
- Use CSS custom properties for dynamic sizing
- Ensure consistent cell dimensions across all grid sizes

### Responsive Behavior
- Grid adapts to available space while maintaining square cells
- Maximum grid size based on viewport dimensions
- Minimum cell size of 20px for touch accessibility
- Smooth scaling between breakpoints

### Content Handling
- Labels and emojis positioned as overlays
- Content doesn't affect cell dimensions
- Text scaling based on cell size
- Icon sizing proportional to cell dimensions

## Implementation Tasks

1. **CSS Grid Layout**
   - [x] Implement aspect-ratio container for maze board
   - [x] Use CSS Grid with equal column/row sizing
   - [x] Add responsive breakpoints for different screen sizes
   - [x] Test across various aspect ratios

2. **Cell Sizing System**
   - [x] Create CSS custom properties for cell dimensions
   - [x] Implement dynamic sizing based on viewport
   - [x] Ensure minimum and maximum cell sizes
   - [x] Add smooth transitions for size changes

3. **Content Overlay System**
   - [x] Position labels and emojis as absolute overlays
   - [x] Scale content based on cell size
   - [x] Ensure content doesn't affect grid layout
   - [x] Implement proper z-indexing

4. **Responsive Testing**
   - [x] Test on various device sizes and orientations
   - [x] Verify square cells maintained across all breakpoints
   - [x] Test with different grid sizes (small to large)
   - [x] Validate touch targets remain accessible

5. **Performance Optimization**
   - [x] Use CSS transforms for smooth scaling
   - [x] Minimize layout recalculations
   - [x] Optimize for 60fps animations
   - [x] Test performance on lower-end devices

## Demo Criteria

**Demo:** Rotate phone â†’ cells remain squares, board adjusts

### Demo Steps
1. Load maze on mobile device
2. Verify cells are perfect squares
3. Rotate device to landscape orientation
4. Confirm cells remain square and grid adjusts
5. Test on tablet and desktop sizes
6. Verify smooth transitions during orientation changes

## Definition of Done

- [x] Grid container uses proper aspect-ratio CSS
- [x] All cells maintain square aspect ratio
- [x] Content overlays don't affect cell dimensions
- [x] Responsive behavior works across all devices
- [x] Smooth transitions implemented
