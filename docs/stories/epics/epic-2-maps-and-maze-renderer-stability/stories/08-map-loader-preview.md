   - Add difficulty ratings and descriptions
   - Implement efficient metadata loading
   - Store and retrieve map information

4. **Selection and Persistence**
   - Implement map selection logic
   - Persist selection in localStorage
   - Handle selection changes and validation
   - Provide clear feedback for selection actions

5. **Integration and Testing**
   - Integrate map picker with existing game flow
   - Test map loading and selection functionality
   - Validate preview generation across devices
   - Ensure smooth user experience

## Demo Criteria

- [x] Selected map is clearly highlighted
- [x] Map selection loads correct layout
- [x] Difficulty indicators are displayed
- [x] Selection persists across sessions
- [x] Demo criteria met
- [x] Code reviewed and tested

## Dependencies
