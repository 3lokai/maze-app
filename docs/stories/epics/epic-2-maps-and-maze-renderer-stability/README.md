# Epic 2 — Maps & Maze Renderer Stability (UX Overhaul)

## Epic Overview

This epic focuses on transforming the maze game into a scalable, responsive, and visually polished experience that works seamlessly across all devices and screen sizes. The goal is to create a foundation for multiple maps while ensuring the renderer can handle larger grids with optimal performance.

## Epic Goals

1. **Multiple Map Support** - Enable players to choose from different maze layouts with varying complexity
2. **Responsive Design** - Ensure the game works perfectly on all devices from mobile phones to desktop computers
3. **Performance Optimization** - Maintain smooth 60fps gameplay even with larger 20×20 grids
4. **Visual Polish** - Create a clean, playful interface that's both functional and engaging

## Story Organization

### Sprint 1: Foundation & Multiple Maps
- **Story 1** - Multiple Maps Library (S)
- **Story 2** - Larger Grid Support (M) 
- **Story 3** - Aspect-Ratio Lock & Square Cells (S)

### Sprint 2: Visual Enhancements & Responsiveness
- **Story 4** - Label & Emoji Overlays (S)
- **Story 5** - Horizontal Viewport & Follow-Cam (M)
- **Story 6** - Responsive Viewport UX (S)

### Sprint 3: Performance & Polish
- **Story 7** - Renderer Performance Optimization (M)
- **Story 8** - Map Loader & Preview (S)
- **Story 9** - UX Overhaul Polish (M)

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
Start with Stories 1-3 to establish the foundation for multiple maps and responsive design. This includes:
- Multiple map loading system
- Grid size validation and support
- Responsive CSS Grid implementation

### Phase 2: Visual Enhancement
Implement Stories 4-6 to improve the visual experience:
- Overlay system for labels and emojis
- Camera system for large grids
- Mobile-responsive layout

### Phase 3: Performance & Polish
Complete with Stories 7-9 to optimize performance and polish the interface:
- Performance optimization for large grids
- Map selection interface
- Final UX polish and accessibility improvements

## Technical Considerations

### Performance Targets
- 60fps animations for all grid sizes
- Memory usage < 50MB for 20×20 grids
- Touch targets ≥44px for accessibility
- Responsive breakpoints: 768px, 1024px, 1440px

### Dependencies
- Existing maze renderer and executor systems
- Frontend specs for responsive design patterns
- Architecture documentation for performance guidelines
- UI component library (shadcn/ui)

### Risk Mitigation
- **Performance**: Profile early with large grids, implement viewport culling
- **Responsiveness**: Test on actual devices, not just browser dev tools
- **Visual Consistency**: Use CSS Grid/Flexbox for reliable layouts
- **User Experience**: Conduct usability testing with target age groups

## Success Metrics

- **Performance**: 20×20 mazes run at 60fps with smooth animations
- **Responsiveness**: Perfect experience on devices from 320px to 1920px+
- **Accessibility**: All controls meet 44px minimum touch target requirements
- **Visual Integrity**: Square cells maintained across all screen sizes and orientations
- **User Experience**: Intuitive map selection and smooth gameplay flow

## Development Notes

- Follow the existing coding standards and component patterns
- Use TypeScript strict mode for all new code
- Implement proper error boundaries and loading states
- Test on actual devices, especially mobile phones and tablets
- Consider accessibility requirements throughout development
- Profile performance regularly, especially for larger grid sizes
