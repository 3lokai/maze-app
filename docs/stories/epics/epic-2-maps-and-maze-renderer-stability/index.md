# ðŸ“‹ Epic 2 â€” Maps & Maze Renderer Stability (UX Overhaul)

## Epic Overview

**Goal:** Transform the maze game into a scalable, responsive, and visually polished experience that works seamlessly across all devices and screen sizes.

**Focus Areas:**
- Multiple map layouts with varying complexity
- Responsive design that maintains visual integrity
- Performance optimization for larger grids
- Enhanced user experience with better controls and feedback

## Story Breakdown

### Sprint 1: Foundation & Multiple Maps
1. **[01-multiple-maps-library.md](stories/01-multiple-maps-library.md)** (S) - Load at least 3 layouts with map switcher
2. **[02-larger-grid-support.md](stories/02-larger-grid-support.md)** (M) - Support up to 20Ã—20 grids without performance degradation
3. **[03-aspect-ratio-lock-square-cells.md](stories/03-aspect-ratio-lock-square-cells.md)** (S) - Maintain perfect square cells across devices

### Sprint 2: Visual Enhancements & Responsiveness
4. **[04-label-emoji-overlays.md](stories/04-label-emoji-overlays.md)** (S) - Render labels/icons as overlays without breaking grid
5. **[05-horizontal-viewport-follow-cam.md](stories/05-horizontal-viewport-follow-cam.md)** (M) - Smooth panning camera that follows player token
6. **[06-responsive-viewport-ux.md](stories/06-responsive-viewport-ux.md)** (S) - Mobile-optimized layout with stacked controls

### Sprint 3: Performance & Polish
7. **[07-renderer-performance-optimization.md](stories/07-renderer-performance-optimization.md)** (M) - 60fps performance for large mazes
8. **[08-map-loader-preview.md](stories/08-map-loader-preview.md)** (S) - Map picker with preview thumbnails
9. **[09-ux-overhaul-polish.md](stories/09-ux-overhaul-polish.md)** (M) - Clean, playful interface with proper button sizing

## Success Criteria

- **Performance:** 20Ã—20 mazes run at 60fps with smooth animations
- **Responsiveness:** Perfect experience on devices from 320px to 1920px+
- **Accessibility:** All controls meet 44px minimum touch target requirements
- **Visual Integrity:** Square cells maintained across all screen sizes and orientations
- **User Experience:** Intuitive map selection and smooth gameplay flow

## Dependencies

- Frontend specs updated for responsive design patterns
- Architecture documentation includes performance guidelines
- Existing maze renderer and executor systems as foundation

## Risk Mitigation

- **Performance:** Profile early with large grids, optimize rendering pipeline
- **Responsiveness:** Test on actual devices, not just browser dev tools
- **Visual Consistency:** Use CSS Grid/Flexbox for reliable layouts
- **User Experience:** Conduct usability testing with target age groups
