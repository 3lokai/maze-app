# üìã Epic 2 ‚Äî Maps & Maze Renderer Stability (UX Overhaul)

---

### **Story 1 ‚Äî Multiple Maps Library (S)**

**As a** player
**I want** multiple maps to choose from
**So that** I can play different layouts with rising complexity.

* **AC:**

  * Load at least 3 layouts (small, medium, large).
  * Maps are BFS-validated solvable.
  * Simple map switcher (Next Map / Dropdown).
* **Demo:** Open app ‚Üí select ‚ÄúMap 2‚Äù ‚Üí maze redraws with new layout.

### **Story 2 ‚Äî Larger Grid Support (M)**

**As a** player
**I want** bigger mazes (15√ó15, 20√ó20)
**So that** the game scales with difficulty.

* **AC:**

  * Renderer supports up to 20√ó20 grids without layout break.
  * Executor runs with no perf degradation.
  * Confetti/trails scale proportionally.
* **Demo:** Load 20√ó20 map ‚Üí board renders, run path executes at 60fps.

---

### **Story 3 ‚Äî Aspect-Ratio Lock & Square Cells (S)**

**As a** player
**I want** cells to stay perfect squares
**So that** the maze doesn‚Äôt distort on different devices.

* **AC:**

  * Board container uses aspect-ratio `width/height`.
  * Each cell maintains aspect-ratio 1.
  * No stretch when labels/emojis present.
* **Demo:** Rotate phone ‚Üí cells remain squares, board adjusts.

---

### **Story 4 ‚Äî Label & Emoji Overlays (S)**

**As a** child
**I want** start/goal labels and emoji sprites inside cells
**So that** they don‚Äôt break the grid shape.

* **AC:**

  * Labels/icons rendered as absolute overlays.
  * Font-size capped; ‚â§390px shows icons only + legend below board.
  * Emojis fixed size, don‚Äôt resize cell.
* **Demo:** Start cell shows üè° overlay, goal shows üå≥; grid stays aligned.

---

### **Story 5 ‚Äî Horizontal Viewport & Follow-Cam (M)**

**As a** player
**I want** the maze to scroll horizontally with my token
**So that** I can explore larger maps without squinting.

* **AC:**

  * Player token stays centered (or lead third).
  * Smooth pan as player moves.
  * Touch-drag disabled (programmatic pan only).
* **Demo:** Queue moves across wide maze ‚Üí board pans smoothly as token advances.

---

### **Story 6 ‚Äî Responsive Viewport UX (S)**

**As a** mobile player
**I want** the maze + controls to adapt on small screens
**So that** I can play comfortably on a phone.

* **AC:**

  * Below 768px: right rail stacks below maze.
  * Queue + buttons scale ‚â•44px.
  * No horizontal scroll unless in map viewport.
* **Demo:** Load on phone ‚Üí maze stacked on top, controls below, no overflow.

---

### **Story 7 ‚Äî Renderer Performance Optimization (M)**

**As a** developer
**I want** the renderer optimized for large mazes
**So that** gameplay remains smooth.

* **AC:**

  * 20√ó20 map runs step animation at 60fps.
  * Memory stable (no leaks across resets).
  * Confetti and trail rendering cost < 10ms per frame.
* **Demo:** Profile in dev tools ‚Üí frame time <16ms during 20√ó20 run.

---

### **Story 8 ‚Äî Map Loader & Preview (S)**

**As a** parent
**I want** to preview maps before starting
**So that** I can choose the right difficulty for my kids.

* **AC:**

  * Map picker shows small preview thumbnail of layout.
  * Selected map highlighted.
