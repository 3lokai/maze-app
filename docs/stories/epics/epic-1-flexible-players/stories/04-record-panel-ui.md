## 🎬 Demo Scenario

**Demo**: Run → Player 1 wins → 🏆 increments; totals update

**Steps**:
1. Set up game with 2+ players with names/emojis
2. Queue and run commands for players
3. Observe record panel during execution
4. Verify wins increment with 🏆 icon
5. Verify crashes increment with 💥 icon
6. Verify steps increment with 👣 icon
7. Check color coding (green for wins, red for crashes)
8. Verify totals row updates correctly

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Core Changes Required

1. **Record Panel Layout Redesign**
   - Redesign record panel layout for enhanced stats display
   - Implement consistent column structure
   - Add proper spacing and alignment
   - Ensure responsive design

2. **Stats Display Enhancement**
   - Add emoji icons for each stat type (🏆💥👣)
   - Implement color coding system
   - Ensure clear visual hierarchy
   - Add proper number formatting

3. **Color Coding System**
   - Green for wins/positive stats
   - Red for crashes/negative stats
   - Neutral colors for steps/counts
   - Ensure accessibility compliance

4. **Totals Calculation**
   - Implement totals calculation for all players
   - Add "Overall" row at bottom
   - Ensure real-time updates during gameplay
   - Handle edge cases (no players, all zeros)

### Files to Modify

- `src/components/GameRail.tsx` - Main record panel redesign
- `src/store/gameStore.ts` - Add totals calculation logic
- `src/types/stats.ts` - Extend stats types if needed
- `src/styles/globals.css` - Add color coding styles

### Stats Display Format

Each player row should display:
```
🐰 Kimaya    🏆 2    💥 1    👣 15
```

Totals row:
```
Overall      🏆 5    💥 3    👣 42
```

### Testing Checklist
