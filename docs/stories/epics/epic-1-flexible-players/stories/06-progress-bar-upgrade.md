## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### Core Changes Required

1. **Progress Bar Component Enhancement**
   - Enhance existing progress bar component
   - Add step counter display
   - Implement percentage calculation

4. **Visual Polish**
   - Add smooth fill animations
   - Ensure proper text contrast
   - Add responsive design considerations
   - Implement accessibility features
