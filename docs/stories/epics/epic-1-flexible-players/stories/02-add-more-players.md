## 🎯 User Story

**As a** parent  
**I want** to add up to 4 players before play  
**So that** kids can take turns

---

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Parent Settings modal: "Add Player" → up to 4
- [x] Record box expands vertically, one row per player
- [x] Turn order cycles round-robin
- [x] Type system supports 1-4 players (not just 1-2)

## 🎬 Demo Scenario

**Demo**: Add Player 2 → Record shows both; executor alternates automatically

**Steps**:
1. Open game (starts with 1 player)
2. Access parent settings (gear icon)
3. Click "Add Player" button
4. Verify record panel now shows 2 player rows
5. Queue commands for both players
6. Run execution - verify turn alternates between players
7. Repeat to add up to 4 players total
8. Verify type system handles all player IDs correctly

// AFTER (Required for Epic1-2)
export type PlayerId = 1 | 2 | 3 | 4;

// Add validation utilities
export const isValidPlayerId = (id: number): id is PlayerId => 
  id >= 1 && id <= 4;

export const getMaxPlayers = (): number => 4;
export const getMinPlayers = (): number => 1;
```
