## ðŸ”§ Technical Considerations

- **UI Layout Changes**: Prototype record panel redesign early
- **Data Migration**: Test v0 â†’ Epic 1 migration thoroughly

### Medium Risk
- **Emoji Compatibility**: Fallback to text tokens if needed
- **Settings Modal Complexity**: Build incrementally with core features first
- **Performance with 4 Players**: Monitor and optimize as needed

### Low Risk
- **Animation Performance**: Use CSS transforms for smooth animations
