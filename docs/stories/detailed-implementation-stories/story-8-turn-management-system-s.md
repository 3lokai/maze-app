- [x] Preserve other player's queue during switch

**Technical Notes:**
- Turn switching logic in Zustand store
- Queue clearing only affects active player
- Visual indicator updates immediately

**Files to Create/Modify:**
- `src/store/gameStore.ts` - Add turn management logic
- `src/components/TurnCard.tsx` - Update turn indicator
- `src/hooks/useTurnManagement.ts` - Turn switching hook
- `src/types/turn.ts` - Turn-related types
