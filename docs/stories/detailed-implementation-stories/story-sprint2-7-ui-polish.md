# Story Sprint 2-7: UI Polish (M)

**As a** child  
**I want** bigger, clearer buttons and visual feedback  
**So that** I can tap confidently and enjoy the game.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Direction/number buttons ‚â•44‚Äì56px, show arrow + label text
- [x] Queue tokens: arrow + number (‚¨Ü√ó3 pill), color-coded per player
- [x] Queue shows "No commands" state when empty
- [x] Preview path (ghost trail) option toggleable in settings
- [x] Executor progress shows progress bar per player
- [x] Tap feedback = bounce animation
- [x] Active player HUD glows
- [x] Player emoji sprites (üê¢ü¶äüê∞ü¶ñ) for turn indicators and tokens
- [x] All interactive elements have proper hover/focus states

**Technical Notes:**
- Use CSS animations for bounce feedback
- Implement progress bars for execution visualization
- Color-code queue tokens by player (emerald/indigo)
- Add glow effect for active player indicator
- Ensure all buttons meet accessibility size requirements
- Use shadcn Progress component for progress bars
- Implement "No commands" placeholder state for empty queue
- Add preview path toggle in accessibility settings
- Use player emoji sprites for visual identification
- Ghost trail should show semi-transparent path preview

**Files to Create/Modify:**
- `src/components/DirectionButtons.tsx` - Enhance button styling and feedback
- `src/components/NumberPad.tsx` - Enhance button styling and feedback
- `src/components/CommandQueue.tsx` - Add color-coded tokens, "No commands" state, and better styling
- `src/components/Executor.tsx` - Add progress bars and enhanced feedback
- `src/components/TurnCard.tsx` - Add glow effect for active player and emoji sprites
- `src/components/PlayerToken.tsx` - Add emoji sprites to player tokens
- `src/styles/animations.css` - Add bounce, glow, and ghost trail animations
- `src/components/ui/progress.tsx` - Ensure progress component is available
- `src/hooks/useAccessibility.ts` - Add preview path toggle option

**Story Dependencies:**
- Depends on Story 4 (Command Builder Interface) for button components
- Depends on Story 5 (Movement Executor Engine) for executor components
- Depends on Story 3 (Two Players & Visual Tokens) for player indicators
- Depends on Story 6 (Collision Detection & Feedback) for animation system

**Demo Criteria:**
Tapping buttons feels responsive, queue tokens playful, progress bar fills.

**Story Size:** Medium (M)

**Priority:** Medium - User experience enhancement
