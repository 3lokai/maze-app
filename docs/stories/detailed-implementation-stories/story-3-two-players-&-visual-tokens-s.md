Story 3: Two Players & Visual Tokens (S)

**As a** player  
**I want** to see two distinct player tokens with trails  
**So that** I can track both players' positions and movement history

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Create `PlayerToken` component with emerald (player 1) and indigo (player 2) colors
- [x] Both players start at maze start position (0,0)
- [x] Render player trails showing movement history
- [x] Create `TurnCard` component showing active player indicator
- [x] Tokens are visually distinct and properly sized for grid cells
- [x] Trail colors match player colors with opacity

**Technical Notes:**
- Player 1: emerald-500, Player 2: indigo-500
- Trail opacity: 0.3 for history, 1.0 for current position
- Use Zustand store for player state management

**Files to Create/Modify:**
- `src/components/PlayerToken.tsx` - Player token component
- `src/components/TurnCard.tsx` - Turn indicator component
- `src/store/gameStore.ts` - Zustand store for game state
- `src/types/player.ts` - Player-related types
