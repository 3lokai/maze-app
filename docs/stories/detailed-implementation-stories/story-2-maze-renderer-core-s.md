Story 2: Maze Renderer Core (S)

**As a** player  
**I want** to see a 10×10 maze grid rendered from JSON data with path visualization  
**So that** I can visualize the game board, see the optimal path, and plan my moves

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Create `MazeRenderer` component that displays 10×10 grid
- [x] Load fixed maze data from `/lib/maze.ts` (JSON structure)
- [x] Render walls, start cell (green), and goal cell (blue)
- [x] Grid scales responsively while maintaining square aspect ratio
- [x] Each cell is clearly visible with proper borders/spacing
- [x] Start position: (0,0), Goal position: (9,9)
- [x] **NEW:** Path route visualization with DFS algorithm
- [x] **NEW:** Route highlighting for optimal path cells
- [x] **NEW:** Player trail visualization with color coding
- [x] **NEW:** Preview path mode for debugging
- [x] **NEW:** Theme label support (Home/Forest badges)

**Technical Notes:**
- Use CSS Grid for maze layout
- Maze data structure: `{ width, height, start, goal, graph: Record<string, Set<string>> }`
- Export helper functions from `/lib/maze.ts`
- **NEW:** Path route generation using DFS algorithm
- **NEW:** Visual distinction between route cells and regular path cells
- **NEW:** Player trail system with emerald/indigo colors

**Files to Create/Modify:**
- `src/components/MazeRenderer.tsx` - Main maze display component with path visualization
- `src/lib/maze.ts` - Maze data and helper functions
- `src/types/maze-app.d.ts` - TypeScript interfaces

**Future Enhancements:**
- Multiple maze layout support
- Dynamic path generation algorithms
- Advanced path visualization options
- Interactive path editing tools
