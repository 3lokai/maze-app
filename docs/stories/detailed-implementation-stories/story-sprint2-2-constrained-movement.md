# Story Sprint 2-2: Constrained Movement (M)

**As a** player  
**I want** my moves blocked if I try to step outside the path  
**So that** I must follow the maze with clear feedback.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Executor checks if next cell ∈ `path[]`
- [x] Illegal move = shake + toast ("Bumped wall at step N"); position unchanged
- [x] Trail only marks path cells
- [x] Movement validation integrated with existing collision detection
- [x] Path constraints work for both players independently
- [x] Visual feedback clearly indicates valid vs invalid moves
- [x] **NEW:** Detailed step-by-step validation with precise error location
- [x] **NEW:** Custom error messages for different collision types
- [x] **NEW:** Path constraint creation from maze data
- [x] **NEW:** Integration with existing collision feedback system

**Technical Notes:**
- Extend `/lib/executor.ts` with path validation logic
- Integrate with existing collision detection system
- Path validation should happen before wall collision checks
- Trail rendering should only occur on valid path cells
- Use existing toast notification system for feedback
- **NEW:** Path constraint creation and validation
- **NEW:** Enhanced error reporting with step information
- **NEW:** Seamless integration with existing systems

**Files to Create/Modify:**
- `src/lib/executor.ts` - Add path validation functions
- `src/hooks/useCollision.ts` - Integrate path validation
- `src/components/MazeRenderer.tsx` - Update trail rendering logic
- `src/types/execution.ts` - Add path validation types

**Story Dependencies:**
- Depends on Story 5 (Movement Executor Engine) for execution logic
- Depends on Story 6 (Collision Detection & Feedback) for feedback system
- Depends on Story Sprint 2-1 (Maze Layout Loader) for path data

**Demo Criteria:**
Queue moves into wall → shake, toast; queue valid path → token follows trail.

**Story Size:** Medium (M)

**Priority:** High - Core gameplay mechanic

**Future Enhancements:**
- Path preview for invalid moves
- Advanced collision detection algorithms
- Performance optimization for large mazes
- Multi-player collision detection
- Path finding assistance
