Story 5: Movement Executor Engine (M)

**As a** player  
**I want** to execute movement commands step-by-step with animation  
**So that** I can see my planned path being executed

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Create `Executor` component with Run/Step controls
- [x] Implement step-by-step execution with 300ms/400ms timing
- [x] Add Slow/Medium speed toggle
- [x] Step button executes single command token
- [x] Run button executes entire queue
- [x] Player tokens animate smoothly between cells
- [x] Trails update in real-time during movement

**Technical Notes:**
- Use `/lib/executor.ts` for pure movement logic
- CSS transitions for smooth animations
- Speed settings: Slow (400ms), Medium (300ms)

**Files to Create/Modify:**
- `src/components/Executor.tsx` - Execution controls
- `src/lib/executor.ts` - Movement logic engine
- `src/hooks/useExecutor.ts` - Execution hook
- `src/types/execution.ts` - Execution-related types
