Story 11: QA & Deployment Preparation (XS)

**As a** developer  
**I want** the app to pass QA and be ready for deployment  
**So that** the game can be shared and tested

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Run parent QA script and fix all issues
- [ ] Deploy to Vercel successfully
- [ ] Tag release as `alpha-01`
- [ ] Ensure no console errors in production
- [ ] Add basic unit tests for executor functions
- [ ] Verify responsive design works on target devices

**Technical Notes:**
- Use Jest/Vitest for unit tests
- Test executor functions with various scenarios
- Vercel deployment with proper environment variables

**Files to Create/Modify:**
- `src/__tests__/` - Unit test files
- `jest.config.js` - Test configuration
- `vercel.json` - Deployment configuration
- `package.json` - Add test scripts
