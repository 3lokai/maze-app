# 7) Responsive Rules

* Maze always square; min `min-w-[320px]`.
* On narrow screens, collapse number row into two lines and keep Run sticky at bottom (safe area padding).
* Queue rail wraps gracefully; numbers may split into two rows â‰¤390px width.
* Prevent CLS: fixed heights for control rows; `min-h-[56px]` on rows.
