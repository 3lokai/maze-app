# 8) State & Disable Logic (UX)

* Disable all input while `executing`.
* Show subtle inline helper when queue is empty: "Tap an arrow, then a number".
* Hard cap expanded steps (e.g., 50) → show toast "That's a long journey! Try fewer steps."
* During executing: disable all inputs and show "Executing… (k/N)".
