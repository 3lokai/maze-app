üìã Nice twist ‚Äî multiplayer for the twins. Let's refine the PRD so **two players alternate turns**, while keeping v0 simple.

# Updated **PRD ‚Äî Coding Maze (v0, 2-Player)**

## 1. Goals & Background

The **Coding Maze** app introduces children (ages 4‚Äì6) to computational thinking through **touch-based command building**. Kids tap arrows (U, D, L, R) and numbers (1‚Äì10) to assemble sequences like `U√ó5, R√ó3`. Pressing **Run** animates their piece step-by-step through a fixed 10√ó10 maze.

This mechanic blends **visual play with symbolic syntax**, reinforcing sequencing, batching, and **deferred execution** ("write first, then run"). Immediate feedback ensures engagement: illegal moves shake + toast; reaching the goal triggers confetti.

v0 is designed for **two players taking alternate turns** ‚Äî each child builds and runs their own sequence, then play passes automatically to the other. This setup encourages turn-taking, cooperative play, and sibling/parent co-play without requiring accounts or complex setup. The app remains **safe, ad-free, and purpose-built for short learning sessions**.

**Current Status: Core path features implemented and ready for future enhancements.**
